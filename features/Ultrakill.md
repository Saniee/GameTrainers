## Current Features for: ULTRAKILL

### Player
* No Damage
* Infinite Dash/Stamina
* Don't Deplete the Railgun charge & Rocket Launcher freeze time charge.
* Infinite Jumps
#### Reading of player values like:
* walk speed
* jump power
* air accel
* wall jump power
* player took dmg variable (If frozen at `Took No DMG`, end screen will award u 5k Points for taking no dmg.)
* raw health value, go nuts
* boostCharges, kinda iffy, it's there if the Infinite Stamina script doesn't work.

### Weapons
! Always disable/unfreeze the values before finishing a level, it's prone to crashing, as the values are dynamic and they're addresses change on each lvl. !
* Revolver Coin Charges
* Red Revolver Charges
* Nailgun Ammo & Magnets
* Railgun Charge
* Rocket Freeze Time Charge

### Other
There are few debug addresses, that if advanced enough, u can use yourself for playing around.
If the game crashes while doing so however, it's not on me :P
