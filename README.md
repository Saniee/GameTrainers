## Cheat Engine Tables, Free of Charge.
Don't ask me for updates, I don't play these games regulary. I will update only when I want.

Only post issues if the game is crashing when using a certain feature.

### How to use:
Most of my tables have a single script that enables all the other scripts.

You either click on the square, or press spacebar to activate it.

From there, u can freely play around.
